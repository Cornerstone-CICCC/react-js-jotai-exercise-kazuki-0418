# React JS - Jotai Exercise

**Goal:** Implement state management using React and Jotai.

## Instructions âœ…

1. Create a new React project by running `npm create vite@latest jotai-exercise`.
2. Run `npm install jotai` to install Jotai in your application.
3. Create one atom store called `user.atom.ts` inside your `src/atoms` directory.
4. In your atom store, create four atoms:
  
   - `firstNameAtom` (string)
   - `lastnameAtom` (string)
   - `ageAtom` (number)
   - `hobbiesAtom` (string array)

5. Create a component called `User.tsx`.

7. Create a form with three input fields (one for firstname, one for lastname, and one for age).
8. Create some checkboxes for hobbies.
9. Clicking on the submit button will update the all four atoms.
10. Commit and push your changes.
